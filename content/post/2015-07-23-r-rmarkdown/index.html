This is an analysis of the 2017 General Social Survey specifically looking at the relationship between the age of the participant and the age of their first child.
The General Social Survey collects data on social trends to gain an understanding on the changes in how Canadians live and their well-being to influence social policies. This survey is important as the data has influences many government programs that have then improved the welfare of Canadians, led to more research about their social life and is used as a teaching tool in post-secondary institutions across Canada. Every year there is a specific theme that the survey focuses on. Specifically, the 2017 GSS will be analyzed and in this year the theme was caregivers and families. The goal of this analysis is to determine if there is a correlation between the age of an individual and the age of their first child. This is an important analysis since understanding the trends of the age of the first children of this population can lead to a better comprehension of the population. This can also have a significant impact on the policies being made because depending on if the population has many individuals with lots of children then there may be need for policies specifically on child care to better help meet their needs. We are hypothesizing as an individual’s age increase the age of the first born will also increase.</p>
